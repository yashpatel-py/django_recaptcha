# Django - reCAPTCHA

## What is reCAPTCHA?
reCAPTCHA is a type of security measure used to distinguish between human users and automated bots on websites. It was developed by Google and is widely used to prevent spam and abusive activity online.

When a user tries to access a website or complete a form that uses reCAPTCHA, they are presented with a challenge such as identifying images that contain certain objects or typing in distorted text. These challenges are designed to be easy for humans to complete, but difficult for bots to solve.

By successfully completing the reCAPTCHA challenge, the user proves that they are a human and not a bot, and can proceed with their intended action on the website. This helps protect websites from spam, fraud, and other malicious activities that bots may try to perform.
